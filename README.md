# hello-world
Just another repository

My name is John McCracken. I am currently a licensed Financial Advisor with USAA. I am seeking to utilize my finance experience in the Information Technology sector. I am a Certified Scrum Master and a Certified Product Owner. Also, I'm currently learning Java. This repository has been created to post some of the code I've written along the way.
